      "According to your graph, GINI went up (from 34 to 38%) after taxes and transfers as well.Just because a random variable that is the aggregate of many other random variables (college enrollment) is not sufficient to make statements about one of the component random variables (college tuition) does not mean that it's unfalsifiable.So how do you falsify it?Also, I didn't ask about a relation between tuition and graduation. I asked about a relation between inequality and enrollment.The underlying paper by Bailey and Dynarski [5] documents pretty clearly that income inequality translates into inequality in educational attainment...Looking at educational attainment* as opposed to enrollment is a bit, um, confusing. Is it your assertion that a higher GINI somehow makes the poor (specifically poor women, if we go by that paper) less willing to study than their richer counterparts?Not that it matters, since the paper doesn't look at inequality at all. All it shows is that higher quintiles have higher graduation rates - this is completely unrelated to the question of whether increasing the size of quintiles effects graduation rates.Also, if you read your source [5] (the middle, not the conclusions), you'd discover that the strongest explanation they have of their results is that children of poorer parents are not as smart as children of rich parents, which explains half the gap. So unless your claim is that higher GINI makes poor kids stupid, it's nonsensical to claim inequality has anything to do with graduation rates.I give up. You have unfalsifiable beliefs which are somehow supported by academic papers on completely unrelated topics. Not anything for me to learn here. \n",

Unfortunately many people insist on doing it, especially (at least it seems to me) in the US (which I guess makes sense, since the Dow Jones is weighted not on market cap, but share price, an equally nonsensical way of doing things). \n",
