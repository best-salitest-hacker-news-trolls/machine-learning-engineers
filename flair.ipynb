      "Then my point is even more important given the proportion of it actually spent on infectious diseases. If that's  so allfired important than why were they doing anything else with that money? The answer, of course, is that it wasn't considered so important until a couple of months ago, and thus, it wouldn't  matter how much money was thrown at them, it wouldn't have solved the fundamental  priority problem. Contra to some of the press, I took the time to read the CDC's summary budget from the government's website. It wasn't hard to find (\"Center for Disease Control\" budget). It's full of things that sound superficially wonderful, but none of it matters if it's being spent incompetently or with priorities not connected to the real world, and throwing \"more\" at such an organization is not a good investment. You can't get away from it. It isn't about  more, it's also about  what.  What matters a  lot. Again, I'd be less vocal about not just handing the government  more if the advocates of  more would pay more attention...  much more attention... to  what, and  how well. But I can't help but notice the advocates of \"more\" seem to consider that an attack, when in all seriousness they really ought to be  leading the charge. If you are an advocate of giving the government more, shouldn't you consider it very important to your own position that what the government already has be used well? You give away an enormous weapon when you leave it solely to your opponents to point out problems! \n",

      "here's an almost comical excerpt from the Cornell study Link.  The data showed that younger workers liked these kinds of offices more than olderworkers. The reason was instructive: they felt they could learn more from their“officemates” in this kind of office. This makes sense, since in interviews a commonreason for wanting to join a company was the opportunity to work with “great” people.Having great people around, whom you rarely see and even more rarely talk to, is not ofreal value. Respondents talked about the much greater learning opportunities in a moreopen environment. Older respondents, in contrast, found it harder to concentrate andmore disruptive. It also seemed the case that older respondents were simply comfortablewith how they had learned to do things over a number of years, and did well. Hmm, that's one interpretation. Here's a simpler interpretation. Younger workers generally aren't going to know what they're doing and need to ask questions, so being able to ask questions is important to them. Older workers already know what they're doing and don't need to ask as many questions, so they don't really get anything out of it. This BTW, squares exactly with my experience. All the benefit of open floor plans go to employees with the least expertise at the expense of the employees with the most expertise. If you're the most talented, expert employee in an office, in general there's not going to be anyone in the office that can answer your questions, so an open office doesn't buy you anything. \n",
