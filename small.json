That&#x27;s just marketing language and confuses things.<p>Mesos is basically an application scheduler. It doesn&#x27;t  manage the base operating systems or machine provisioning. Mesos is concerned with ensuring that one or multiple applications are launched and running on a cluster of machines.<p>The Saltstack framework is the only thing I know of that would provide all the primitives and control necessary for an operator to truly control a full 5-300,000 node datacenter from one station.

It also can do configuration management etc if you want, or a lot of people use it to just trigger existing chef&#x2F;puppet jobs.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Saltstack in conjunction with Mesos to build out this full datacenter-as-OS stack.

I&#x27;m not sure that credit cards&#x2F;micropayments would be more expensive in this regard than tax -- there&#x27;s plenty of tax fraud too.<p>I&#x27;m mostly concerned with that your model would appear to me to extend the status quo -- where a lot of low quality content get a lot of views, and generate a lot of the profit -- while it&#x27;d be better to have a system that promoted more diverse and &quot;better&quot; content -- generally that&#x27;d be a slide towards more decentralized publishing&#x2F;more personal publishing.<p>This is of course entirely subjective.","1505093":"It likely would work.
